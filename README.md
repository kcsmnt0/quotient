This is a library for working with quotient types in cubical Agda, attempting to abstract away some of the cubical boilerplate involved in defining functions and proofs over quotient types. See [numbers](https://github.com/kcsmnt0/numbers) for examples.

##### Dependencies:
- [cubical](https://github.com/agda/cubical)
- [agda-stdlib](https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib)
